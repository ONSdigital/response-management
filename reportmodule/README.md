This project contains the code required to provide reporting functionality to a CTP SpringBoot Application.
It is the responsibility of the application to create the report tables in it's own schema, and to wire the application 
class in order to allow Spring to locate the report modules classes correctly.

For an example see the CaseSvc main application class Spring @annotations.
